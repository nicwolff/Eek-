Eek is a Mac OS X LaunchAgent that will check some URL every time your Mac connects to the Internet 
and delete important files if it finds certain text in the response. So, if your nice MacBook is 
stolen or lost, you can create a file at that URL and the first time someone goes on-line with it 
you can trust that it'll clean out your passwords, bookmarks, SSH keys, &c. Just put the file "Eek" 
at ~/Library/Application Support/Eek, and the file "Eek.plist" at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/Eek.plist - 
and edit "URL" in Eek and "username" in the plist.

Then, if your Mac disappears, you can just put a file at URL containing the words "EEK A MOUSE" and 
as soon as your Mac connects to a network it'll see that file and clean up your private data. Of course, 
it's not a bad idea to change the names of these files just in case the person who has your Mac has 
seen this page!
